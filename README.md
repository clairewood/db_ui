# db_ui

Database UI for Intro the Databases class. 

Should be live at this link: http://flip3.engr.oregonstate.edu:9167/ <br>
(flip1 and flip2 had so much traffic I kept getting fork errors)

To see the live database on PHPMyAdmin, go to database > db-connector.js for login info.

To load the database with a file: <br>
 - add the source SQL file to database folder <br>
 - in MariaDB, run: source ./database/filename.sql;


TO DO LIST: 
- drop diagnostic table from DB
- add .gitignore to project root
- test that "forever" works 
- turn some form inputs into dropdown menus
- make sure every file has a source citation
- fix bug
