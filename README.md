(Unless forever stopped working in node)<br>
 
If getting errors when trying to use node in flip servers, run this: <br>
 --> nvm install 16.0.0 

To load the database with a file: <br>
 - add the source SQL file to database folder <br>
 - in MariaDB, run: source ./database/filename.sql;

TO DO for next week: <br>
- Do whatever Step 4 Final assignment says to do <br>
- Fix Materials and Colors so they dynamically populate <br>
- Fix in_stock so it automatically changes to YES or NO for 1 or 0 <br>
- Fix auto-incrementing for item_id <br>
- Change table header names to real names (qty_on_hand to Quantity) <br>
- Add auto-refresh code to UPDATE and DELETE <br>
