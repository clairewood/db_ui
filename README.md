To load the database with a file: <br>
 - add the source SQL file to database folder <br>
 - in MariaDB, run: source ./database/filename.sql;


TO DO:
- fix bug that won't add new row to Items table based on form input
- drop diagnostic table from DB
- add .gitignore to project root
- test that "forever" works 
- turn some form inputs into dropdown menus
- make sure every file has a source citation
