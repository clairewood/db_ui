If getting errors when trying to use node in flip servers, run this: <br>
 --> nvm install 16.0.0 

To load the database with a file: <br>
 - add the source SQL file to database folder <br>
 - in MariaDB, run: source ./database/filename.sql;


TO DO: <br>
- add UPDATE to app.js <br>
- add DELETE to app.js<br>
- add all other tables (do not have to have CRUD capabilities)<br>
- Update app.js with the backend from the end of step 8

BEFORE SUBMITTING: <br>
- drop diagnostic table from DB <br>
- test that "forever" works <br>
- turn some form inputs into dropdown menus <br>
- make sure every file has a source citation <br>
- figure out why auto incremented ID in Items is doing weird stuff <br>
- delete add_item.js from public folder if we end up sticking with form submittal method <br>
