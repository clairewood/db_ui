Database UI for Intro the Databases class. <br>

This project and the files in it were based on a NodeJS Starter App provided to us by the Oregon State University staff for the CS 340 Intro to Databases class. <br>
Contributors to the app, in the form of their github usernames: gkochera (George Kochera), Cortona1, currym-osu, and dmgs11. <br>
The starter app was accessed on 3/14/2023 (and many times before it) at this link:  https://github.com/osu-cs340-ecampus/nodejs-starter-app <br>
